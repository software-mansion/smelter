# `@swmansion/smelter-web-wasm`

Provides API to create and manage Smelter instances for browser environment. Smelter rendering engine is compiled to WASM and
runs entirely in the browser without any additional infrastructure.

> Caution: Browser support is limited to Google Chrome and other Chromium based browsers. Support for Safari and Firefox is planned.

## Usage

```tsx
import { useCallback } from 'react';
import Smelter, { setWasmBundleUrl } from '@swmansion/smelter-web-wasm';
import { View, Text, InputStream } from '@swmansion/smelter';

setWasmBundleUrl('/assets/smelter.wasm'); // URL to WASM bundle

function SmelterApp() {
  return (
    <View>
      <InputStream inputId="camera-input" />
      <Text style={{ fontSize: 20 }}>Hello world</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

function BrowserApp() {
  const videoRef = useCallback(
    async (video: HTMLVideoElement | null) => {
      if (video) {
        await startSmelterInstance(video);
      }
    },
    []
  );

  return <video ref={videoRef} />
}

async function startSmelterInstance(video: HTMLVideoElement) {
  const smelter = new Smelter();
  await smelter.init();

  // register input/outputs/images/shaders/...

  await smelter.registerInput('camera-input', { type: 'camera' });

  const { stream } = await smelter.registerOutput('output', <SmelterApp />, {
    type: 'whip',
    endpointUrl: 'https://example.com/whip',
    bearerToken: '<EXAMPLE TOKEN>',
    video: {
      resolution: { width: 1920, height: 1080 },
    },
    audio: true,
  });

  await smelter.start();

  video.srcObject = stream;
  await video.play();
}
```

In this example, `BrowserApp` represents regular React website that hosts the smelter instance
and `SmelterApp` is a totally separate React tree that represents a rendered video.

The final video is both sent over WHIP protocol and the preview is displayed with `<video />` tag on
the website.

See our [docs](https://smelter.dev/docs) to learn more.

## Configuration

In the example above, we are calling `setWasmBundleUrl` that should point to the WASM bundle that
is part of the `@swmansion/smelter-browser-render` package.

To learn how to configure it in your project check out our [example configurations](https://smelter.dev/ts-sdk/configuration#configuration).
